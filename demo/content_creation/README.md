# Agno Multi-Agent Content Creation Demo

A comprehensive demonstration of multi-agent systems using the [agno framework v1.7.6](https://pypi.org/project/agno/1.7.6/). This project showcases an AI-powered content creation agency where specialized agents collaborate to produce high-quality content.

## ü§ñ Meet the AI Team

This demo features 5 specialized agents working together in a coordinated workflow:

- **üîç Research Agent** - Gathers comprehensive information and market insights
- **üìã Content Strategist** - Develops content strategy and SEO optimization plans  
- **‚úçÔ∏è Writer Agent** - Creates engaging, well-structured content
- **üìñ Editor Agent** - Reviews, fact-checks, and ensures quality standards
- **üéØ Project Manager** - Coordinates workflows and manages deliverables

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Agents work together through coordinated workflows
- **Custom Tools**: Specialized tools for research, content planning, writing quality assessment, and project management
- **Flexible Workflows**: Complete content creation pipeline from research to final delivery
- **Interactive Demo**: Multiple demo modes including quick demo, interactive mode, and collaborative sessions
- **Real-time Coordination**: Agents hand off work and coordinate through the project manager
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in editorial review and quality checking processes

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- agno framework v1.7.6
- Anthropic API key (for Claude models)
- Optional: OpenAI API key for additional model options

> **Note**: This demo is specifically designed for agno v1.7.6. The API imports, model initialization, and tool definitions have been updated to match this version's structure. Tools now use the `@tool` decorator pattern instead of class inheritance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Test the installation (optional but recommended):
```bash
python test_imports.py
# Or run comprehensive tool validation
python validate_tools.py
```

## üéÆ Running the Demo

### Quick Start
```bash
python demo.py
```

This will launch an interactive menu with several demo options:

1. **Quick Demo** - Runs a predefined "AI in Healthcare" content creation workflow
2. **Interactive Demo** - Choose your own topic and parameters  
3. **Collaborative Demo** - See agents working together on specific challenges
4. **Agent Details** - Learn about each agent's capabilities and tools

### Command Line Usage

You can also import and use the workflow programmatically:

```python
from demo.workflows.content_creation_workflow import ContentCreationWorkflow

# Initialize the workflow
workflow = ContentCreationWorkflow()

# Run complete content creation process
results = workflow.run_complete_workflow(
    topic="AI in Healthcare",
    content_type="blog_post", 
    target_audience="healthcare professionals",
    deadline="2024-12-31"
)

# Generate report
report = workflow.generate_workflow_report(results)
print(report)
```

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Agents

1. Create agent class in `demo/agents/`
2. Define specialized tools and instructions
3. Add to workflow in `demo/workflows/content_creation_workflow.py`

### Creating Custom Tools

1. Use the `@tool` decorator from `agno.tools`
2. Define function with proper type hints
3. Add descriptive docstring with Args and Returns
4. Import and add to relevant agent configurations

Example:
```python
from agno.tools import tool

@tool(
    name="my_custom_tool",
    description="Description of what the tool does"
)
def my_custom_tool(param1: str, param2: int = 10) -> dict:
    """
    Tool function description.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of first parameter
        param2: Description of second parameter
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary with results
    """
    return {"result": f"Processed {param1} with {param2}"}
```

### Extending Workflows

1. Modify `ContentCreationWorkflow` class
2. Add new workflow steps or parallel processes
3. Update agent coordination and handoffs
